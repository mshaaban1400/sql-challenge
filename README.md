### Background

In this activity, as the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling

After looking over the included CSV files, I headed over to QuickDBD and created this ERM.

1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.

2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
